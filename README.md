## Version Control

Please do not commit directly to the master branch, unless it's absolutely necessary and ok to do so.

Start a feature branch and do enough testing. When you're done, submit a pull request on github.

Use the following command to make a new branch:

        git checkout -b [new-branch-name]

To see the differences between the current branch you are on and origin/master, do:

        git diff origin/master

To merge changes in master to your current branch, do:

        git pull
        git merge master

When you're done committing all your changes, push the changes to your branch remotely:

        git push origin [branch-name]

Then you can go to github and submit a merge request by pressing the button

To view difference between two branches, do:

        git diff [branch1] [branch2]

For example, you can do:

        git diff origin/master origin/[my-branch]
